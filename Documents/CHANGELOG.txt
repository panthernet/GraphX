RELEASE 2.2.0
NEW TERMS: 
	VAESPS - vertex and edge skip processing support
	VCP - vertex connection point

HIGHLIGHTS:
	* VCPs has been added into GraphX making edge endpoint fixation(binding) possible. By default GraphX automaticaly calculates edge endpoint position relative to vertex dimensions 
	   and approximate math shape, but with this feature on you'll be able to bind edge endpoint to a separate customizable object. This will allow you to create static edge fixation
	   endpoints on the vertex and give you full control over edge endpoints positioning.
	* Now you can easily customize edge pointers with the help of DefaultEdgePointer class which can host any content including Image/Path and supports rotation. Changes include more 
	   precious edge endpoint calculations so the edge will overlap with the edge pointer no more. Because of these changes the old logic that utilizes direct Path object in EdgeControl 
	   template will be removed completely in favor of notable performance improvements.
	* Now GraphX for WPF requires only .NET Framework 4.0 to build & run. Deprecated all code that required .NET 4.0.3.
	* Now you can use "http://schemas.panthernet.ru/graphx/" XAML namespace in GraphX for WPF for all its visual content. Additionaly, output filenames for WPF/METRO dlls are both changed to 
		GraphX.Controls.dll so Post-Build process copies output files to GraphX/Bin folder with distinct filenames reflecting the platform as before.
	* Performance improvements are always welcome. In this release the whole layout calculation logic has been revisited in terms of both performance and code quality gains. We've also eliminated
		some redundant layout updates, moved all math & algorithms handling from GraphArea directly to LogicCore under better async implementation, cleaned up ZoomControl logic,
		revisited edges & edge labels code to remove redundant calculation passes.

DETAILED CHANGELOG:
+ Added support for custom VCP [WPF, METRO]
	* New control class added: StaticVertexConnectionPoint. It represents ContentControl which can host virtualy any valid object
	* VCP support the same math shapes as VertexShape property or can use VertexShape::None value to disable roundtrip calculations

BREAKING CHANGES:
* !!!WARNING!!! This GraphX version has fallen under the heavy hand of code refactoring and along with the numerous code improvements 
	almost ALL of the namespaces has been changed to better reflect logical code grouping and ease additional platform support through code reusability. 
	Also i've get rid of the several different XAML xmlns usings in favor of single one. I'm very sorry that this changes will force you to update your 
	GraphX projects but i realy felt that i must do it once and for all. You will have to change most of the usings in code and XAML templates: i strongly
    recommend you to use Resharper or any other code quality tool which will help to do this in minutes (or even seconds).

	Core changes:
	- All controls, behaviours and their interfaces are moved to GraphX.Controls namespace
	- All algorithms are spreaded across GraphX.PCL.Logic.Algorithms namespace with additional OverlapRemoval, LayoutAlgorithms, EdgeRouting endings
	- All base models and interfaces are now in GraphX.PCL.Common.Models namespace
	- All GraphX primitives (Point, Rect, etc.) are left in GraphX.Measure for better code readability in cases when they are intersected with System.Windows namespace twins

* IGXLogicCore now include ExternalLayoutAlgorithm, ExternalOverlapRemovalAlgorithm, ExternalEdgeRoutingAlgorithm for simplier external algo assignment
* Now GraphX for WPF requires only .NET Framework 4.0 to build & run
* EdgeLabelControl no longer needs default Angle binding and RenderTransformOrigin setup. They are processed internally [WPF]
* GraphArea::GenerateGraph() method now has generateAllEdges param True by default.
* Renamed following peoperties, moved them to EdgeControlBase and implemented them as DependencyProperty:
	* LogicCore::EdgeSelfLoopCircleOffset -> SelfLoopIndicatorOffset
	* LogicCore::EdgeSelfLoopCircleRadius -> SelfLoopIndicatorRadius
	* LogicCore::EdgeShowSelfLooped -> ShowSelfLoopIndicator
* Renamed following ZoomControl properties:
	* ZoomDeltaMultiplier -> ZoomSensitivity
	* MaxZoomDelta -> MaximumZoomStep
* Completely deprecated EdgeControl::PART_edgeArrowPath template PART in favor of the new DefaultEdgePointer (PART_EdgePointerForSource & PART_EdgePointerForTarget). 
	Please renew your custom templates. You can find an example in Generic.XAML template.
* Self looped edges display logic has been slightly changed with the introduction of custom template PART (PART_SelfLoopedEdge). Now LogicCore::SelfLoopIndicatorOffset
is (0,0) by default and indicator is shown in the top left vertex corner minus indicator size. You can change this behavior by overriding EdgeControl::PrepareSelfLoopedEdge() method.
* GetVertexSizeRectangles() method moved from GraphArea to LogicCore.
* Edge labels placement logic has been slightly changed when they are applied to parallel edges. Labels offset now translates them into different directions, for ex. one up, one down, one up.. etc. 
	This behavior helps to better place labels for double parallels. Also parallel edge labels now are not flipped when axis changes during label rotation. If you're uncomfortable with these changes, 
	please let me know!

RELEASE 2.1.8
+ Added basic support for Image based edge pointers. Introduced new object for EdgeControl template: [WPF, METRO(bugged)]
	1. EdgePointerImage class with name "PART_EdgePointerImageForSource" - marks edge source pointer (new!)

+ Moved all WPF interfaces to GraphX.Controls.Models.Interfaces namespace and all METRO interfaces to GraphX.Controls.Models.Interfaces [WPF, METRO]
+ Edge rotation now needs additional modification for all custom EdgeLabelControl templates. Please add: <Setter Property="RenderTransformOrigin" Value="0.5,0.5" />[WPF, METRO]
+ Due to new calc cancelation feature the following has been changed:
	- IExternalEdgeRouting, IExternalLayout, IExternalOverlapRemoval interfaces and different algorithm base classes now implement Compute(CancellationToken cancellationToken) method with an additional param
	- METRO now works only in async mode. Postfix Async has been added for GraphArea graph generation and relayout methods.

	Supported options:
		> Default
		> Freeze - freeze object position and use it in consequent calculations to pin the object (limited algorithms support)
		> Exclude - exclude object from calculations completely though it will remain in supplied graph (supported everywhere)

RELEASE 2.1.3 WIP

+ Added experimental METRO support

+ Redesigned libraries for PCL implementation
	This shouldn't lead to major problems but some breaks will definetly occur:
	- All routines in Logic library now operates with custom System.Windows types (platform-specific libraries operates (externaly) with System.Windows types). This includes any custom algorithms. 
	- DataSaveModel class renamed to GraphSerializationData 
	- Althought file operations such as Save/load layout remains the same for the end user the background logic of this features has been changed:
		- Implemented IFileServiceProvider interface and corresponding property in GXLogicCore class
		- When you assign GraphArea::LogicCore property the new default (platform-specific) FileServiceProvider is created and assigned to LogicCore automaticaly (if corresponding property is null)
		- You can create custom FileServiceProviders to work with 3rd party serialization libraries or code your own file operations logic

RELEASE 2.0: PORT-READY Edition
+ Spearated GraphX into the 3 projects: GraphX.Common, GraphX.Logic and GraphX.Controls. Each project serves its own purpose.

WIP 2.3.5
FEATURES HIGHLIGHT:
 - Added new awesome vertex snapping feature on vertex drag. Many thanks to perturbare for this wonderful contibution! The feature is implemented around DragBehaviour class 
 and is represented in several new settings allowing the drag to be perform around some sort of virtual snap grid. Please read the comment for the DragBehaviour class for detailed info.

DETAILED CHANGELOG:
 - Added Universal Windows Application support and example project
 - Added StateStorage::ImportState() method to allow state import/export logic between several graphs
 - Added GraphArea::IsDisposed property that indicated that GraphArea object has been disposed and shouldn't be used anymore
 - Added GraphArea::CreateNewStateStorage() protected method to be able to implement custom state storage logic for GraphArea
 - Added ParameterizedLayoutAlgorithmBase::EnsureUniqueRandomInitialPositions property that enables unique random positions generation for layout algorithms. False by default, True for LinLog algorithm.
 - Added VertexControl::VCPRoot property whcih represents the VCP root container for easier runtime VCP management. To be able to use it you have to define PART_vcproot template element as Panel descendant.
 - Added new awesome vertex snapping feature on vertex drag (thanks to perturbare)
 - Fixed edge label positioning, now it is more accurate for pathed edges
 - Fixed LinLog negative energy issue (thanks to Katya)
 - Fixed one vertex ISOM algorithm exception (thanks to jorgensigvardsson)
 - Fixed external alg vertex sizes grab logic (thanks to ValentinMarinov)
 - Made StateStorage class extensible by adding virtual modifiers to methods
 - Improved algorithm factory logic to avoid graph type cast exceptions in some class declaration cases

RELEASE 2.3.4
DETAILED CHANGELOG:
 - Further improvements to printing logic. GraphArea::PrintDialog() method now takes print DPI as the first parameter and always fit content int page.

RELEASE 2.3.3
DETAILED CHANGELOG:
 - Exposed internal PrintHelper class with new CalculateEstimatedDPI() method which can calculate DPI required for image export based on specified criterias
 - Fixed arrows display issue when printing 

RELEASE 2.3.2
DETAILED CHANGELOG:
 - Added GraphArea::ExportAsImageDialog() method which act as old ExportAsImage and the ExportAsImage() method now accepts filename to work without the dialog

BREAKING CHANGES:
 - GraphArea::ExportAsImage() now takes filename as the first parameter and don't have save file dialog (use GraphArea::ExportAsImageDialog() instead)

RELEASE 2.3.1
DETAILED CHANGELOG:
 - Added default templates for attached vertex and edge labels
 - Added HighlightBehavior::HighlightedEdgeType attached property that indicates In or Out edge is currently highlighted. Default value is None.
 - Added GraphArea::GetRelatedVertexControls() and GraphArea::GetRelatedEdgeControls() methods to fetch corresponding objects faster and easily
 - Added new printing logic. Now you can use GraphArea::PrintDialog() and GraphArea::PrintVisibleAreaDialog() methods with extended optional parameters
 - Added new image export logic. Now GraphArea::ExportToImage() method allows graph image export in original size via optional parameter
 - Added GraphArea::SetPrintMode() method which is used internally by print and image export methods but can be useful to override due to complex GraphArea print preparation logic.
 - Fixed excessive rendering issue when ZoomControl viewfinder is hidden. Should significantly increase performance of the viewfinder in this case.
 - Fixed showcase app edge example graph
 - Fixed ZoomControl viewbox logic to correctly react on zoom control background change
 - Improved attachable labels logic. Simplified base classes, added checks for mandatory base classes
 - Improved attachable labels customization possibilities by making several methods virtual

BREAKING CHANGES:
 - Made DefaultLabelFactory class abstract and it is now accepts only one generic param (output object type)
 - GraphAreaBase now has new abstract members needed to be overriden in derived controls: GetRelatedVertexControls(), GetRelatedEdgeControls(), SetPrintMode()
 
KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Graph image export may throw OutOfMemoryError for large graphs


RELEASE 2.3.0

HIGHLIGHTS:
	* Added new layout algorithm GroupingLayoutAlgorithm which allows to layout graph vertices by different groups each using its own sublayout algorithm. You can see it in action using new feature highlight in showcase app.
      Currently there are two modes supported:
		- Layout groups to predefined bounds, when you can specify rectangular bounds in which vertices are layed (Bounds must be supported by algorithm used to layout vertices group)
		- Generate bounds from groups, when each group is layouted using its algorithm and bounds are automatically calculated to fit all vertices in the group and then group bounds overlaps can be removed.
	* Added two new label controls AttachedEdgeLabelControl and AttachedVertexLabelControl which acts like separate entities in GraphArea visual tree and have weak references to graphx controls. Default EdgeLableControl and VertexLabelControl are designed to act as the part of their parent classes and this approach impacts their customization possibilities when these parent classes are limited in size. So with the new labels you can mitigate following restrictions:
		- No more label cuts when vertex is strictly limited in width or height
		- No more jerky edge endpoints when edge label is too large
		- No more labels behind edges or vertices. You can control how to inject them		
	To use new labels you have to add AttachableVertexLabelControl and/or AttachableEdgeLabelControl XAML templates and also set GraphArea::VertexLabelFactory / EdgeLabelFactory.

DETAILED CHANGELOG:
	+ Added GroupId property to IGraphXVertex interface
	+ Added parameters class RandomLayoutAlgorithmParams for corresponding algorithm. It contains Bounds property which can restrict vertex coordinates to respect provided bounds.
	+ Added two methods to EdgeControl: GetEdgePointerForSource() and GetEdgePointerForTarget() which allows to get to edge pointer objects manualy

	+ Added GraphArea::VertexLabelFactory and GraphArea::EdgeLabelFactory properties for corresponding label factories. Will generate labels automatically after the graph layout if defined
	+ Added GraphArea::MoveToFront() and GraphArea::MoveToBack() methods that will move specified GraphArea child to the top/bottom of the visual tree respectively
	+ Added MouseEventArgs for VertexDoubleClick event to be able to correctly block click event when you're dragging vertex and open dialog window at once
	+ Added VertexControl::HideWithEdges() and VertexControl::ShowWithEdges() methods to hide/show the control and all related edges at once
	+ Added new optional parameters for GraphArea add/remove objects methods to allow vertex/edge data to be added to data graph in a single method call

	+ Made many methods virtual/protected for easier derived classes customization
	+ Merged GraphArea code for WPF & METRO into the shared files
	+ Merged EdgeControl and VertexControl code for WPF & METRO into the shared files


BREAKING CHANGES:
	* Changed Vertex and Edge ID type to Int64 (long) by default for easier id handling when working with databases and huge datasets. Was Int32.
	
	* IExternalLayoutAlgorithm interface now demands TEdge generic specification and have one new method ResetGraph().
	* All built-in algorithms now use IMutableVertexAndEdgeSet<TVertex, TEdge> for TGraph generic specification to be able to modify Graph data on demand.
	* Added mandatory IOverlapRemovalAlgorithm::Initialize() method for all OR algorithms to be able to initialize initial data not only when you instantiate class but at any time
	* IZoomControl interface now must implement Width and Height properties
	* IOneWayControlAnimation interface methods AnimateVertex/AnimateEdge now has an additional parameter which flags if data vertex/edge should be deleted after animation is complete.
		Any custom delete animations should be updated to handle this additional property.
	* HighlightBehaviour::HighlightStrategy property has been removed due to redundancy


RELEASE 2.2.0
NEW TERMS: 
	VAESPS - vertex and edge skip processing support
	VCP - vertex connection point

HIGHLIGHTS:
	* VCPs has been added into GraphX making edge endpoint fixation(binding) possible. By default GraphX automaticaly calculates edge endpoint position relative to vertex dimensions 
	   and approximate math shape, but with this feature on you'll be able to bind edge endpoint to a separate customizable object. This will allow you to create static edge fixation
	   endpoints on the vertex and give you full control over edge endpoints positioning.
	* Now you can easily customize edge pointers with the help of DefaultEdgePointer class which can host any content including Image/Path and supports rotation. Changes include more 
	   precious edge endpoint calculations so the edge will overlap with the edge pointer no more. Because of these changes the old logic that utilizes direct Path object in EdgeControl 
	   template will be removed completely in favor of notable performance improvements.
	* Now GraphX for WPF requires only .NET Framework 4.0 to build & run. Deprecated all code that required .NET 4.0.3.
	* Now you can use "http://schemas.panthernet.ru/graphx/" XAML namespace in GraphX for WPF for all its visual content. Additionaly, output filenames for WPF/METRO dlls are both changed to 
		GraphX.Controls.dll so Post-Build process copies output files to GraphX/Bin folder with distinct filenames reflecting the platform as before.
	* Performance improvements are always welcome. In this release the whole layout calculation logic has been revisited in terms of both performance and code quality gains. We've also eliminated
		some redundant layout updates, moved all math & algorithms handling from GraphArea directly to LogicCore under better async implementation, cleaned up ZoomControl logic,
		revisited edges & edge labels code to remove redundant calculation passes.

DETAILED CHANGELOG:
+ Added support for custom VCP [WPF, METRO]

BREAKING CHANGES:
* !!!WARNING!!! This GraphX version has fallen under the heavy hand of code refactoring and along with the numerous code improvements 
	almost ALL of the namespaces has been changed to better reflect logical code grouping and ease additional platform support through code reusability. 
	Also i've get rid of the several different XAML xmlns usings in favor of single one. I'm very sorry that this changes will force you to update your 
	GraphX projects but i realy felt that i must do it once and for all. You will have to change most of the usings in code and XAML templates: i strongly
    recommend you to use Resharper or any other code quality tool which will help to do this in minutes (or even seconds).

	Core changes:
	- All controls, behaviours and their interfaces are moved to GraphX.Controls namespace
	- All algorithms are spreaded across GraphX.PCL.Logic.Algorithms namespace with additional OverlapRemoval, LayoutAlgorithms, EdgeRouting endings
	- All base models and interfaces are now in GraphX.PCL.Common.Models namespace
	- All GraphX primitives (Point, Rect, etc.) are left in GraphX.Measure for better code readability in cases when they are intersected with System.Windows namespace twins

* IGXLogicCore now include ExternalLayoutAlgorithm, ExternalOverlapRemovalAlgorithm, ExternalEdgeRoutingAlgorithm for simplier external algo assignment
* Now GraphX for WPF requires only .NET Framework 4.0 to build & run
* EdgeLabelControl no longer needs default Angle binding and RenderTransformOrigin setup. They are processed internally [WPF]
* GraphArea::GenerateGraph() method now has generateAllEdges param True by default.
* Renamed following peoperties, moved them to EdgeControlBase and implemented them as DependencyProperty:
	* LogicCore::EdgeSelfLoopCircleOffset -> SelfLoopIndicatorOffset
	* LogicCore::EdgeSelfLoopCircleRadius -> SelfLoopIndicatorRadius
	* LogicCore::EdgeShowSelfLooped -> ShowSelfLoopIndicator
* Renamed following ZoomControl properties:
	* ZoomDeltaMultiplier -> ZoomSensitivity
	* MaxZoomDelta -> MaximumZoomStep
* Completely deprecated EdgeControl::PART_edgeArrowPath template PART in favor of the new DefaultEdgePointer (PART_EdgePointerForSource & PART_EdgePointerForTarget). 
	Please renew your custom templates. You can find an example in Generic.XAML template.
* Self looped edges display logic has been slightly changed with the introduction of custom template PART (PART_SelfLoopedEdge). Now LogicCore::SelfLoopIndicatorOffset
is (0,0) by default and indicator is shown in the top left vertex corner minus indicator size. You can change this behavior by overriding EdgeControl::PrepareSelfLoopedEdge() method.
* GetVertexSizeRectangles() method moved from GraphArea to LogicCore.
* Edge labels placement logic has been slightly changed when they are applied to parallel edges. Labels offset now translates them into different directions, for ex. one up, one down, one up.. etc. 
	This behavior helps to better place labels for double parallels. Also parallel edge labels now are not flipped when axis changes during label rotation. If you're uncomfortable with these changes, 
	please let me know!

RELEASE 2.1.8
+ Added basic support for Image based edge pointers. Introduced new object for EdgeControl template: [WPF, METRO(bugged)]
	1. EdgePointerImage class with name "PART_EdgePointerImageForSource" - marks edge source pointer (new!)

+ Due to new calc cancelation feature the following has been changed:
	- IExternalEdgeRouting, IExternalLayout, IExternalOverlapRemoval interfaces and different algorithm base classes now implement Compute(CancellationToken cancellationToken) method with an additional param
	- METRO now works only in async mode. Postfix Async has been added for GraphArea graph generation and relayout methods.

	Supported options:
		> Default
		> Freeze - freeze object position and use it in consequent calculations to pin the object (limited algorithms support)
		> Exclude - exclude object from calculations completely though it will remain in supplied graph (supported everywhere)

	- DataSaveModel class renamed to GraphSerializationData 
	- Althought file operations such as Save/load layout remains the same for the end user the background logic of this features has been changed:
		- Implemented IFileServiceProvider interface and corresponding property in GXLogicCore class
		- When you assign GraphArea::LogicCore property the new default (platform-specific) FileServiceProvider is created and assigned to LogicCore automaticaly (if corresponding property is null)
		- You can create custom FileServiceProviders to work with 3rd party serialization libraries or code your own file operations logic

- Image export currently supports only *ZoomControl* visible area export
- Moved *ImageType* enum into *GraphX* namespace
- Moved all properties associated with logic from GraphArea to *GXLogicCore* class
- Removed *Zoombox* from project completely (now only *ZoomControl* is supported and being actively enchanced)


RELEASE 1.0.1
+ Changed *ExportToImage()* parameters: added *useZoomControlSurface* param that enables zoom control parent visual space to be used for export instead *whole GraphArea* panel.
	Using this technique it is possible to export graphs with negative vertices coordinates.
+ Added common interface *IZoomControl* for all included Zoom controls
+ Added new method *GraphArea.GenerateGraph()* that accepts only optional parameters and will use internal *GraphArea.Graph* property as the source (assuming it was already set earlier or exception will be thrown)
+ Added new method *GraphArea.SetVerticesDrag()* that controls edge drag mode for all vertices that are added into the GraphArea
+ Added new method *GraphArea.SetVerticesMathShape()* that sets math shape for all vertices that are added into the GraphArea
+ Added Windows Forms interop compatibility mode. You must specify *GraphArea.EnableWinFormsHostingMode* property for this to work.
+ Added edge parallelization as the post-process algorithm
	+ Added *GraphArea.EnableParallelEdges* and *GraphArea.ParallelEdgeDistance* properties
	+ Added *EdgeControl.CanBeParallel* property
+ Fixed some code definitions

RELEASE 1.0.0
+ Added optional automatic ID assignment for data edges and vertices when using *Area.GenerateGraph()* method. Only absent IDs are assigned with unique values
+ Addded *VertexControl.MathShape* property which affects how edge connectors are rendered on the vertices
	+ Added types are: rectangle, circle, diamond, triangle
+ Added new mouse over animation *ScaleControlAnimation*
+ Added new *GraphArea.DeleteAnimation* and corresponding animation logic
+ Added new *GraphArea.MouseOverAnimation* and corresponding animation logic
+ Added MouseEnter/Leave edge events for *GraphArea* and fixed some old ones
+ Added some new animations for newly implemented animation types
+ Added *GraphArea.SideExpansionSize* property which sets additional space around graph area. Created for scale animation to not being cut by area borders.
+ Fixed potential *EventOptions* memory leak
+ Fixed mistype in *GraphArea.DefaultEdgeRoutingAlgorithm* name
+ Redesigned Themed Graph templates for better visual experience. Now they are cool :)
- Removed *VertexControl.MouseOverAnimation* animation property
- Removed MainVertex logic as it is not universal. Removed corr. param from *GraphArea.GenerateGraph()* method.

BETA 0.9.5
+ Added *GraphArea.SaveAsImage()* method that supports different image formats
+ Added *GraphArea.UseNativeObjectArrange* property. True by default. If set to False it will use different coordinates handling that helps to soften vertex drag issues to the top and left area sides.
+ Added *GraphArea.Translation* property. It is needed to get correct translation coordinates when determining object position from the mouse coordinates.
+ Added new *VertexControl.PositionChanged* event along with the new *VertexControl.EventOptions* property that allows enable/disable and do tracking of the vertex control position change and other events.
+ Added imported *CompoundFDP* layout algorithm (from Graph#)
+ Added new *PathFinder* edge routing algorithm first preview
+ Added *ZoomControl.UseAbsoluteZoomOnMouseWheel* property to enable absolute coord zooming by mousewheel
+ Added some commented samples for old *ZoomControl* as dragging is good with it right now.
+ Added additional params into *VertexControl* constructor.
+ Added new save/load procedures using *YAXLib* serialization
+ Added some new GraphX unique exception types along with the new validation checks
+ Fixed *GraphAreaBase* arrange calculation to include edge routing points into the formula
+ Fixed *ZoomControl* Fill and Fit features with new arrange mode
+ Fixed vertex dragging example in Showcase app to correctly add vertices with different scaling and *GraphArea* panel size.
+ Fixed odd edge routing calculation of endpoints (connector points). Now it looks much better when dragging vertex with *UpdateEdgesOnMove* flag set.
+ Fixed Showcase app tooltips implementation to always update them on show.
+ Fixed *ZoomControl* content rendering when not using native arrange mode (still doesn't accurate)
+ Fixed *ExportToImage()* image rendering when not using native arrange mode
+ Fixed *ExportToImage()* parameters handling
+ Improved Zoombox rendering speed
+ Improved rendering performance a bit. Overal performance improvement and tweaks.
+ Made *GraphArea.SetX / SetY* to set *FinalX* and *FinalY* attached props by default with the same value. Now all external animation coord routines needs optional param *alsoSetFinal* set to False if they are dealing with X and Y coords only.
+ Made *GraphArea.TopLeft* property visible
+ Made animation launch algorithm to be able to launch vertex and edge animations independently.
+ Removed *VertexControl.IsTracePositionEnabled*. Moved functionality into *EventOptions* property.
+ Removed redundant *OnGraphGenerateFinished()* call
+ Renamed external namespaces by adding lead GraphX name (external lib compatibility issues resolved)
+ Reworked *EdgeControl* vertex position tracing to use *VertexControl* trace implementation instead.


BETA 0.9.4
+ Added Xceed *Zoombox* control into the library. The old one is still there for compatibility and stuff...
+ Added optional params into *EdgeControl* constructor
+ Added *GraphArea.GetVertexPositions* method
+ Added ability to area-select vertices using zoom control fuctionality
+ Added visual vertex search and display example, manual edge drawing example in Dynamic Graph tab
+ Added *VertexControl.GetPosition()* method that returns Point coordinates of the control in GraphArea panel
+ Added methods to print *GraphArea* and export it as PNG image, updated Showcase app
+ Added tooltips to Showcase app -> Edge Routing Graph -> edge bundling params and adjusted edge bundling example to produce more visible result
+ Made *EdgeControl.DashStyle* property as DependencyProperty
+ Made relative mouse wheel zoom default for *Zoombox* control
+ Made edge arrow template object mandatory. Now it can be excluded from the EdgeControl template.
+ Fixed Showcase app -> Edge Routing Graph -> edge bundling relayout
+ Fixed edges rendering when ShowArrows and ShowLabel properties has been changed

BETA 0.9.3.1
+ Fixed extensive edges rendering

BETA 0.9.3
+ Added smooth curves support for all algorithms using *GraphArea.UseEdgeCurving* property.False by default. Specifies that edge curving technique must be used to display graph edges.
+ Added edge bundling support
+ Added looped edges support
+ Added dashed edges support
+ Added parameters classes for all edge routing algorithms
+ Added *GraphArea.RemoveVertex* and *GraphArea.RemoveEdge* methods
+ Added edge labels support
+ Added showcase graph for edge routing examples
+ Added showcase graph for dynamic operations examples (selection, addition, removal etc.)
+ Added support for dynamic edge routing while dragging vertices
+ Added optional parameter to *GraphArea.Relayout()* and *GraphArea.GenerateGraph()* methods to generate all possible edges if none are present or update existing edges after calculations are done.
+ Added *bool UpdateEdgesOnMove* property to *DragBehaviour* to update edge routing while dragging vertex. By default this is False resulting in better performance as edges are redrawn only after dragging is finished.
+ Fixed edges drawed above vertices
+ Fixed *GraphArea.GenerateGraphFinished* event call
+ Too many other changes to document all of them. Read updated documentation for the most latest info.

Some of the breaking changes
+ Edge base class replaced by *EdgeBase<TVertex>* that implements all essential properties by default
+ Vertex base class replaced by *VertexBase* that implements all essential properties by default
+ GraphState property *VisibleEdges* type changed to *List<TEdge>*. Route points no longer stored in *EdgeControl*, they are stored in *EdgeBase* instead.
+ Edge and vertex data objects IDs is now of type INT32
+ Removed *IMoveAnimation* interface. Use *MoveAnimationBase* class instead as the base class.
+ Reworked move animation mechanics to batch-execute. All methods and logic changed. See documentation on the web site for more info.
+ *DragBehaviour* no longer require X and Y attached properties which has been removed.

RELEASE 2.0.3
+ Added MouseUp event global handling for VertexControl
+ Improvement: GXLogicCore expected concrete class as TGraph (thanks to stefanpe)
+ Removed redundant dependencies
+ Fixed edge labels positioning
+ Fixed custom control loading into GraphArea
+ Fixed EdgeControl data context bug after graph deserialization

RELEASE 2.0.2
+ Added vertex control labels with following functionality:
	+ 2 available positioning modes: by sides or by coordinates
	+ Always attached to vertex and moves with it
	+ Rotation angle support
	+ Same template logic as in EdgeLabelControl
+ Added key modifiers to vertex event args
+ Added XAML templates usage example in WF project
+ Added new layout type Custom. When set layout algorithm calculation is skipped completely and manually added data is used for OR and ER algorithms (if any).
+ Added (reintroduced) GraphArea::SideExpansionSize property which gets or sets additional space for GraphArea borders. Useful for zoom adjustments when custom text or controls which are not used in size calculations must fit into the zooming.
+ Added IGraphControlFactory-Interface and Implementation for Edge and Vertex controls creation (thanks to Paul Mandalka)
+ Added simple Nuget-Package specification for GraphX (use createPackage.bat to create the nuget package for GraphX) (thanks to Paul Mandalka)
+ Added new ZoomControl::ZoomAnimationCompleted event (thanks to Paul Mandalka)
+ Fixed hidden edges update on vertex drag
+ Fixed PrintHelper::ExportToImage method to use DPI-Settings for Image Rendering (thanks to Paul Mandalka)
+ Fixed labels rendering for parallel edges. Now they are displayed separately for each edge.
+ Fixed async calculations being broken due to LogicCore property became dependency
+ Fixed ViewFinder not deriving ZoomControl content background
+ Fixed edge label update on alignment change
+ Fixed self-looped edges handling in GraphArea::GenerateEdgesForVertex() method
+ Fixed bugs with edge routing calculation in some cases
+ Fixed: Graph-Area LogicCoreProperty was registered using GraphAreaBase which could cause a problem (thanks to Paul Mandalka)
+ Fixed visual properties recovery terminating template values 
+ Fixed Sugiyama and EfficientSugiyama algorithms calculation with only one vertex
+ Implemented some properties as dependencies
+ Implemented EdgeControl::IsSelfLooped property as read-only dependency property.
+ Reworked EdgeLabelControl inner logic. Should now be more flexible and performance efficient.

+ Some code refactoring. Minor performance improvements.

RELEASE 2.0.1

+ Added ZoomControl::ToContentRectangle() method which translates screen rectangle coordinates to content rectangle coordinates
+ Added correct endpoints rendering for parallel edges on a rectangular vertex shape (thanks ro bleibold)
+ Added some hooks for ZoomControl to notify Presenter::RenderTransform on scale/translation changes. Now bindings to that property are correctly refreshed.
+ Added additional handling of custom objects in GraphArea (eg. clearing)
+ Added dependency property for GraphArea::LogicCore
+ Added new property GraphArea::EnableVisualPropsRecovery. Gets or sets if visual properties such as edge dash style or vertex shape should be automaticaly reapplied to visuals when graph is regenerated.
	Turning this off can save a bit of performance if you don't use custom values.
+ Added new property GraphArea::EnableVisualPropsApply. Gets or sets if visual properties such as edge dash style or vertex shape should be automaticaly applied to newly added visuals which are added using AddVertex() or AddEdge() or similar methods.
	Turning this off can save a bit of performance if you don't use custom values and making many manual edge/vertex create or remove operations.
+ Added GraphArea::SetVerticesHighlight() and GraphArea::SetEdgesHighlight() methods for easier highlight feature handling.
+ Improved some showcase code
+ Improved GraphArea code performance (slightly)

+ Fixed issue with incorrect rendering of parallel edges (thanks to bleibold)
- GraphArea::Children property has been hidden. Use EdgesList and VertexList properties and corresponding methods instead.


RELEASE 2.0: PORT-READY Edition
+ Spearated GraphX into the 3 projects: GraphX.Common, GraphX.Logic and GraphX.Controls. Each project serves its own purpose.
  * *GraphX.Logic* contains all the logic and algorithms 
  * *GraphX.Common* contains common objects between logic and visual controls
  * *GraphX.Controls* contains visual controls and all associated classes
+ Added GraphArea.LogicCore property that must be set in order to be able to work with GraphArea
+ Added parallel edges logic call in *GraphArea.UpdateAllEdges()* method
+ Added some code improvements and corrections, made some classes internal, abstract or sealed
+ Added *EdgeControl::AlignLabelsToEdges* and *EdgeControl::LabelVerticalOffset* properties that implements edge labels alignment to edges at different angles.
	Labels now can be placed at the same angle as edge is drawn and optionaly offseted up or down to not overlap the edge itself.
+ Added some recently implemented features to Showcase app
+ Added optional param to *GraphArea::GenerateAllEdges()* that enables GraphArea layout update before edges calculation. True by default.
+ Added minimap from Zoombox to ZoomControl and changed some of its features.
+ Added new method *ZoomControl::ZoomToContent()* that should be used instead of ZoomTo() method
+ Added *ZoomControl* display in VS design view with minimap preview
+ Slightly improved rendering performance for large graphs
+ Fixed long living issue with zoom content resize and vertex drag which involves following global changes:
	+ Correct GraphArea size rectangle can now be only determined by *GraphArea::ContentSize* property which contains rectangle that includes all visuals. GraphArea visual size is ALWAYS fixed at (10,10).
	+ Now all vertices and edges positioned in *GraphArea* using TOP-LEFT corner as the position coordinates (previously coordinates was pointing at the object center).
	+ ZoomControl now closely tied with GraphX, though it can be made universal
+ Fixed edge labels rendering issue
+ Fixed some showcase app exceptions
+ Fixed edge labeling showcase example
+ Fixed GraphArea in design diplay mode
+ Fixed ParameterizedLayoutAlgorithm exception (thanks to thinkJD)
+ Fixed parallel edges calculations in case of opposite-directed edges (thanks to thinkJD)
+ Fixed invalid parallel edges detection in some cases (thanks to bleibold)
- Image export currently supports only *ZoomControl* visible area export

- Removed *Zoombox* from project completely (now only *ZoomControl* is supported and being actively enchanced)


RELEASE 1.0.1

+ Added new method *GraphArea.GenerateGraph()* that accepts only optional parameters and will use internal *GraphArea.Graph* property as the source (assuming it was already set earlier or exception will be thrown)

+ Added new method *GraphArea.SetVerticesMathShape()* that sets math shape for all vertices that are added into the GraphArea
+ Added Windows Forms interop compatibility mode. You must specify *GraphArea.EnableWinFormsHostingMode* property for this to work.
+ Added edge parallelization as the post-process algorithm
	+ Added *GraphArea.EnableParallelEdges* and *GraphArea.ParallelEdgeDistance* properties
	+ Added *EdgeControl.CanBeParallel* property

BETA 0.9.5
+ Added *GraphArea.SaveAsImage()* method that supports different image formats
+ Added *GraphArea.UseNativeObjectArrange* property. True by default. If set to False it will use different coordinates handling that helps to soften vertex drag issues to the top and left area sides.
+ Added *GraphArea.Translation* property. It is needed to get correct translation coordinates when determining object position from the mouse coordinates.
+ Added new *VertexControl.PositionChanged* event along with the new *VertexControl.EventOptions* property that allows enable/disable and do tracking of the vertex control position change and other events.
+ Added imported *CompoundFDP* layout algorithm (from Graph#)

+ Fixed *ExportToImage()* image rendering when not using native arrange mode
+ Fixed *ExportToImage()* parameters handling
+ Improved Zoombox rendering speed
+ Improved rendering performance a bit. Overal performance improvement and tweaks.
+ Made *GraphArea.SetX / SetY* to set *FinalX* and *FinalY* attached props by default with the same value. Now all external animation coord routines needs optional param *alsoSetFinal* set to False if they are dealing with X and Y coords only.
+ Made *GraphArea.TopLeft* property visible
+ Made animation launch algorithm to be able to launch vertex and edge animations independently.
+ Removed *VertexControl.IsTracePositionEnabled*. Moved functionality into *EventOptions* property.
+ Removed redundant *OnGraphGenerateFinished()* call
